## Latitude - Latitude vs. X analysis of Weather Analysis Dashboard
A visualization dashboard website is created by using either the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge.

As you build this dashboard, you'll create a page for each plot and a way to navigate among these pages. These pages should contain the visualizations and the descriptions. Youâ€™ll also create two more pages. One will be a landing page that provides a comparison of all the plots. The other will be a page that presents the data used to build the plots.

## The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
### landing page :
An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
### Four visualization pages :
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The visualization itself for the selected comparison.(latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed). The images that these pages display should be stored in the assets/images folder.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
### Comparisons page :
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
### Data page :
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table must be a bootstrap table component.
The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. Try using a tool you already know, pandas. Pandas has a method called to_html that allows you to generate a HTML table from a pandas dataframe.
